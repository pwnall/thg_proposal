\def\title{Mechanisms for Trusted Computation using Mainstream Computers}
\def\expectedcompletetiondate{September 2016}
\def\briefproblemstatement{
We set out to design a system for performing trusted computation on mainstream
desktop and server-class computers. Our system has three mutually distrusting
parties: \textit{a data owner} has some private information, and allows
\textit{a software provider} to perform some computation on the private data,
using hardware resources provided by \textit{an infrastructure owner}. The
computation result is communicated to either the data owner or to the software
provider, in encrypted form.

We aim to build a system that can prevent malicious software from colluding
with either malicious infrastructure, or with another piece of malicious
software running on the same infrastructure, for the purpose of leaking private
data that is not included in the computation result. We rely on a processor's
ability to create a protected execution environment that is isolated from the
system software. Our trusted computing base (TCB) includes the computer's main
processor (CPU), and a \textit{trusted runtime} that verifies and launches the
untrusted software, and mediates its interactions with the software outside the
protected environment. Our TCB does not include the operating system or any
high-level software that runs on the infrastructure.
